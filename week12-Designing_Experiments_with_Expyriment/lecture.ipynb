    "* PsychoPy is made for non-coders. You create experiments with a drag'n'drop-interface, you analyze your data in Excel, ... -> GUIs have a lack of flexibility & control, limiting the scope of experimental settings\n",
    "* It's dependencies are still outdated and lack support (wxPython's newest Ubuntu/Debian installation instructions are for 2011's versions? https://wiki.wxpython.org/InstallingOnUbuntuOrDebian)\n",
    "* It is not really cross-platform-compatible (meaning there is a *different* (huge) set of errors you'll encounter on the platform of your choice)\n",
    "* There are still many, many unexpected things and bugs.\n",
    "* Installation is still far from easy or quick, and it requires *hundreds* of dependencies:"

    "In two experimental tasks, participants have to respond to a rectangle on the screen, according to its color (red or green), by pressing the left or the right arrow key on the computer’s keyboard. Additionally, the position of the rectangles can be either left or right. Each trial will start with the presentation of a fixation cross for 500 ms, ollowed by the rectangle that will remain on the display until a response is given. Between trials, a blank screen is shown for 3,000 ms. Each block will contain 128 trials in random order. The two tasks will differ only in the mapping of responses (i.e., which button to press for which color), which will be shown to the participant as a brief  nstruction at the beginning of each block. The order of tasks will be counterb alanced over participants. The experiment has a 2×2×2×2 factorial design, with the within-subjects  actors Color (red, green), Position (left, right), and Task (left = green, left = red), as well as the between-subjects factor Task Order (left = green first,left = red first).
